# BetterMediaKeys
BetterMediaKeys is a browser extension that works with Chromium-based browsers and Firefox. It allows you to skip forward to the next chapter using the next track key (⏩) and also go back to the pervious chapter using the pervious track key (⏪) on YouTube. 

You can normally use the left and right arrow keys in combination with the alt key and the control key to skip foward or go back to the relevant chapters, however this is cumbersome and with the additional requirement that the tab must be currently in focus. mediaSession action handlers do no have this restriction.
